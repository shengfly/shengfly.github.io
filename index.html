		<h4>We have been awarded by the National Institutes of Health for a 4-year support of our project, "Deep Learning Based Phenotyping and Treatment Optimization of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction" (1R01HL159183-01A1). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major public health problem that is rising in prevalence with the aging population. By performing deep phenotyping of the patients from their Cardiac Magnetic Resonance images and Electronic Health Record simultaneously, we aim to provide phenotypic-specific, individualized treatment optimization based on the current massive amount of clinical data using deep learning.</h4>

		<h4>I have received the 2021 MGH Thrall Innovation Grants Award for funding my research of lung cancer screening by transformed chest X-ray imaging. The project is called "Chest Radiographs-based Lung Cancer Screening by the DeepProjection Technique" based on the DeepProjection technique previously developed by us which can generate near-real volumetric 3D CT image from a single 2D Chest Radiograph (CXR) image. By replacing CT scans with CXR-generated pseudo-CTs for lung cancer screening, we can reduce radiation doses, scan time and cost for the screening, as well as better availability for remote healthcare sites.
